# Phase 19: Implementation — Finance & Payments (~65 Apps × 5 Variants)

> Test strategy: none
> Source roadmap: `tasks/roadmap.md`

**Goal**: Build all five variants for every app in the Finance & Payments cluster.

**Scope**:
- Apps: Banking, wallets, payments, investing, crypto, budgeting, neobanks, credit, tax, lending, insurance-adjacent, market-data, and portfolio tools.
- Shared patterns: account dashboards, transaction history, transfer flows, portfolio views, charts/graphs, biometric-auth placeholders, PCI-adjacent security patterns, KYC/AML blockers, fraud/risk review, disputes, regulated disclosures, and provider data freshness.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Exact Phase 19 inventory reconciled with app IDs, app names, repo slugs, source specs, and downstream readiness.
- [ ] All Phase 19 apps have 5 working variants each or explicit local/toolchain/provider/payment/licensed-data/identity/regulatory/security blockers.
- [ ] Every variant passes validation and has benchmark or local validation score evidence recorded.
- [ ] Account dashboards, transaction history, transfer/payment/investing flows, portfolio/chart surfaces, auth/security states, dispute/support flows, and regulated disclosures are functional across variants or explicitly blocked by local/provider/regulatory constraints.
- [ ] Category-specific risk review for finance, payments, investing, crypto, lending, tax, insurance-adjacent, fraud, identity, and financial-data features is documented.

**Parallelization:** agent-team

**Coordination Notes:** Independent repos. Share financial chart, transaction, account-dashboard, auth/security, provider freshness, dispute/support, and risk-review patterns. Bank/payment rails, card networks, brokerage/custody/exchange integrations, open-banking providers, tax/credit/loan/insurance logic, KYC/AML, sanctions screening, market-data licensing, PCI-adjacent storage, biometric auth, fraud/risk, and regulated disclosures must stay blocked until verified with lawful sandbox/provider/device/regulatory access.

### Execution Profile
**Parallel mode:** serial
**Integration owner:** main agent
**Conflict risk:** low
**Review gates:** inventory correctness, private repo verification, source-spec presence, no GitHub Actions, finance/regulatory/privacy/security blocker review

### Implementation

- [x] Step 19.1: Reconcile exact Finance & Payments app inventory and downstream readiness
  - Reconciled 72 apps across IDs 056–065 (10), 137–147 (11), 472–522 (51) from Phase 9 Step 9.12 build-plan evidence.
  - Serial GitHub API verification: `checked=72, pass=72, fail=0`. All PRIVATE, default `main`, README present, source spec present, root commit present, no `.github/workflows`.
  - Pre-scan rate limit: `core: 5000/5000, reset: 1780506911`. Post-scan: `core: 4712/5000, reset: 1780506937`. No 403/429/auth failures.
  - Classified 15 risk groups: P2P payments (3), digital wallets (4), traditional banking (13), neobanks (8), investing/brokerage (13), crypto exchange/custody (5), crypto wallets (5), market data/news (3), budgeting/personal finance (4), credit/loans/BNPL (3), remittance (6), crypto on-ramp (2), payroll/earned-wage (1), rewards/cashback (1), social investing (2).
  - Carry-forward blockers documented: KYC/AML/sanctions, payment rails/card networks, bank-link/open-banking, brokerage order routing/custody, crypto exchange/on-chain, lending/credit underwriting, market-data licensing, PCI-adjacent storage, biometric/native auth, fraud/risk, remittance/cross-border, tax/disclosures, real balances/transactions, disputes/chargebacks, financial disclosures/regulatory notices, region/regulator controls.
  - Full inventory and blocker posture recorded in `tasks/repo-seeding.md` under "Phase 19 Finance & Payments Inventory (72 Apps)".

- [ ] Step 19.2: First Finance & Payments implementation tranche
  - Select 5–6 apps from the P2P payments and digital wallets risk groups for the first tranche.
  - Build original static prototypes with `index.html`, `package.json`, `src/styles.css`, and `src/app.js` for each app.
  - Prototypes should cover synthetic account dashboard, transaction history, send/receive/request flows, contact/recipient selection, payment method management, balance display, notification preferences, and support/security placeholders.
  - Mark all payment rail, KYC/AML, bank-link, biometric, and fraud/risk features as explicitly blocked.
  - Verify each downstream repo retains PRIVATE visibility, `main` branch, README, source spec, root commit, and no `.github/workflows` after push.
  - Record rate-limit evidence before and after in `tasks/repo-seeding.md`.
  - Files: downstream repos, `tasks/todo.md`, `tasks/repo-seeding.md`, `tasks/history.md`.

### Milestone: Phase 19 — Finance & Payments Complete
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Exact Phase 19 inventory reconciled with app IDs, app names, repo slugs, source specs, and downstream readiness.
- [ ] All Phase 19 apps have 5 working variants each or explicit local/toolchain/provider/payment/licensed-data/identity/regulatory/security blockers.
- [ ] Every variant passes validation and has benchmark or local validation score evidence recorded.
- [ ] Account dashboards, transaction history, transfer/payment/investing flows, portfolio/chart surfaces, auth/security states, dispute/support flows, and regulated disclosures are functional across variants or explicitly blocked by local/provider/regulatory constraints.
- [ ] Category-specific risk review for finance, payments, investing, crypto, lending, tax, insurance-adjacent, fraud, identity, and financial-data features is documented.
